# DOM-PROJECT
HELLO, NOT SURE ON HOW TO DO THIS. HAHAHA
Basically, i built this to put my basic DOM knowledge to practice.
With this, im able to get the concept of adding a new item, after the submit button has been clicked and search for item and also delete items.

THINGS I LEARNT
- ARRAY.FROM()
CONFIRM()
CONTAINS()
and many more...

IF THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO WRITE A README, PARDON ME, ITS MY FIRST TRIAL.
WOULD DO BETTER NEXT TIME.
